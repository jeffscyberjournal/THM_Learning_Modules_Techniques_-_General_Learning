# Lateral Movement and Pivoting

## Task 1 Introduction

The room teaches lateral movement techniques used by attackers after gaining an initial foothold in an Active Directory (AD) environment. You’ll learn how attackers move between hosts with minimal detection, use alternative authentication materials, and pivot through compromised machines. Completing the Breaching AD and Enumerating AD rooms first is recommended.

### Networking Setup

#### AttackBox

- If using the web-based AttackBox, you’re auto‑connected to the network.
- You must manually configure DNS to resolve AD hostnames:
```
sed -i '1s|^|nameserver $THMDCIP\n|' /etc/resolv-dnsmasq
```
- Test DNS with:
```
nslookup thmdc.za.tryhackme.com
```
- DNS resets every ~3 hours, so you may need to repeat the setup.
- Record your lateralmovement interface IP — this is your attacker IP for reverse shells.

#### Own Machine (OpenVPN)

- Download the VPN config from the access page.
- Connect using:
```
sudo openvpn user-lateralmovementandpivoting.ovpn
```
- After “Initialization Sequence Completed,” verify connection on the access page.
- DNS must still be configured manually.

#### Kali VM

- Use Network Manager GUI to set DNS to the THMDC IP.
- Add a secondary DNS (e.g., 1.1.1.1) for internet access.
- Restart NetworkManager.
- Test DNS by visiting:
```
http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds
```

### Getting Initial Credentials

- Visit the distributor site to obtain your AD username/password.
- These credentials allow SSH access to:
```
thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com
```
using:
```
ssh za\<username>@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com
```
This jump host simulates your initial foothold in the environment.

### Reverse Shell Note
Always use the IP of the lateralmovement interface as your attacker IP for any reverse connections.
